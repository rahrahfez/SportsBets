# SportsBets
A project that allows peer to peer sports wagering.

- Allows users to create/open a bet.
- Allows users to accept the bet from another user.
- Current implementation will randomly generate a number between 1-100 every 15 mins.
- A user can open a bet of higher/lower of a number of their choosing.
- Another user can accept that bet, whoever wins will recieve the winnings from the wager.
- All bets are removed once the number is generated and a new bet will need to be created.
- All users start out with a balance of 100 points.
- Points can be added/refilled once every hour.

- Future implementation will allow wagers to be placed on live sporting events.
- Will use an API that recieves live Vegas odds that can be wagered upon or used as reference for a new bet.
